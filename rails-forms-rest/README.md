# Rails Forms and REST

Learning objectives:

1. Describe how form data is authenticated by Rails for security
2. Practice using Rails form-builder syntax instead of writing pure HTML
3. Nest params values in a named hash like we did in Sinatra
4. Compare how Rails controllers handle "one by one" attribute assignment vs mass assignment from the params hash
5. Write a method to return strong params during object create or update
